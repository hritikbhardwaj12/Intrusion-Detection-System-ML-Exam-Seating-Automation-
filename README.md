# Intrusion-Detection-System-ML-Exam-Seating-Automation-
Developed a real-time intrusion detection system using ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) on the KDD dataset; integrated with a Flask-based web interface to visualize predictions and security insights. Automated the generation of clash-free, session-wise exam seating plans using student-course mapping.
